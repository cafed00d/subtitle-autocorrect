#  This file maps common OCR misspellings to the corrected spellings.
#
#  IMPORTANT!!!!
#    For each entry, the misspelling and its correction must be exactly the same
#    length! The utility correct OCD mistakes, thus it replaces one letter with
#    another; it doesn't auto-correct words the way that a cell phone might.
