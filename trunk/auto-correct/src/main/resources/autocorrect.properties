#  This section maps identifies OCR misspellings that cannot be handled
#  automatically, and their corrections.
#
#  IMPORTANT!!!!
#    For each entry in this section, the misspelling and its correction must be
#    exactly the same length! The utility replaces one letter with another; it
#    doesn't auto-correct words the way that a spelling checker might.

#  This section is for words that the auto-correction algorithms will attempt
#  to "correct" and thus end up with misspellings.
#
#  IMPORTANT!!!!
#    For each entry, there should not be any text after the equals sign.
